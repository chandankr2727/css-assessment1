    <ol id="ordered">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media.</li>
        <li><b><s>CSS is not necessary</s> <span class="bg" >CSS saves a lot of work.</span> </b>It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once.</li>

    </ol>
    <h4 class="head" >CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h4>
    <ul id="unordered">
        <li>Inline - by saving the style attributes inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style elements in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link elements in link in an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS. Is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="bg">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>

    </ul>
    <p class="para">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique elements. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an elements and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="para">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific elements or range of elements on a webpage. Once an elements has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    <p class="para">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
